# Covid-19_Vaccine-Management
- You are required to develop a program to manage the vaccination process of FPT university students. The 
vaccination management program must allow administrators to manage student vaccination information. In 
addition, the program also provides a function for students to view information about the vaccine that they have 
been vaccinated. To simplify the application building, we give the following business roles:

1. Each student can only inject a maximum of 2 injections of the vaccine.
2. The second dose of vaccine must be given 4 to 12 weeks after the first injection
3. Two vaccines must be of the same type.

    - Injection information is stored in the injection.dat file
    - The student.dat file has stored student information including studentID and name fields.
    - The vaccine.dat file has stored vaccine information including vaccineID and name fields.
